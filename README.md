### Project description

Online zoo website

The main idea of the project is to provide users with the opportunity to observe wild animals in a zoo or a nature reserve and, most importantly, to give them the possibility to easily donate to the needs of the animals that they like.

There are *4 types of pages:*

   * Landing page
   * Map page
   * Animal page (4 different pets: panda, alligator, gorilla, eagle)
   * 404 page

**The main goals were** 
* to create the pages according the design from Figma 
* to do adaptive pages (4 possible width: 1920px, 1200px, 640px, 320px)
* to implement an option to toggle between a light and dark mode 
* to activate several carousels using vanilla JavaScript.
